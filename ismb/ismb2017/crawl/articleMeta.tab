5028882005	PMID28882005			Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	1367-4803	1367-4811	9808944	2017	research-article		Hallen, Mark A; Donald, Bruce R				CATS (Coordinates of Atoms by Taylor Series): protein design with backbone flexibility in all locally feasible directions.	<p>UNASSIGNED</p> When proteins mutate or bind to ligands, their backbones often move significantly, especially in loop regions. Computational protein design algorithms must model these motions in order to accurately optimize protein stability and binding affinity. However, methods for backbone conformational search in design have been much more limited than for sidechain conformational search. This is especially true for combinatorial protein design algorithms, which aim to search a large sequence space efficiently and thus cannot rely on temporal simulation of each candidate sequence.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We alleviate this difficulty with a new parameterization of backbone conformational space, which represents all degrees of freedom of a specified segment of protein chain that maintain valid bonding geometry (by maintaining the original bond lengths and angles and ω dihedrals). In order to search this space, we present an efficient algorithm, CATS, for computing atomic coordinates as a function of our new continuous backbone internal coordinates. CATS generalizes the iMinDEE and EPIC protein design algorithms, which model continuous flexibility in sidechain dihedrals, to model continuous, appropriately localized flexibility in the backbone dihedrals ϕ and ψ as well. We show using 81 test cases based on 29 different protein structures that CATS finds sequences and conformations that are significantly lower in energy than methods with less or no backbone flexibility do. In particular, we show that CATS can model the viability of an antibody mutation known experimentally to increase affinity, but that appears sterically infeasible when modeled with less or no backbone flexibility.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Our code is available as free software at https://github.com/donaldlab/OSPREY_refactor .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> mhallen@ttic.edu or brd+ismb17@cs.duke.edu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i5	28882005		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx277	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882005	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i5/3953990	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx277.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcIwggG-BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGvMIIBqwIBADCCAaQGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMxwDE95UtRdbaG1O0AgEQgIIBdS8GkIlvXkk-_u6NsnBrDe3GsJk18Y0KQxPan7woH9U2oz7bgSvcQ-2MLfe0aIqIVPMLE3pzwPsd9ufJucbL1Z0TRx8izo6TEWbXRun59j_ZL13kI11W21jczcfu_x_FljxNo09nRZP3tJzcnjJ8K-UD05jKmBETZrLOEqMWC0B_s0Mqyw8GHKz6yeaVPGE5GDAAuC5jOEnqDJGeaMAyT2uWfaC9W-RqdxZLE7Gmf0aOUZcwOEH7wA3Ppb2XNEhq82FFDrh1GS5X7GV0lfos7j-gsjHLjPVEp73LyD0DPhJI3l2cpysA7Od3ySpdCZ1X5I8WEU9zVJ7RXn-eaidztLtaAYh1c2N-afOuEhVSp5jajSBJRM_0YdsHd5NOIBJkdpXwGc3ann3eXYk_GJDedt5wzx9h2Hpu_oVsLi28LFXYkmPI6seeyEXQOA1a6hOK8JgfgbhaKs3SUoJR1Cwec8jXpU4WyQeFclYHPR9yBW3Y0D0Fqw0		28882005.main.html	28882005.main.pdf

The available methods to assess the impact of these variants rely primarily upon evolutionary conservation with little to no consideration of the structural and functional implications for the protein. They further do not provide information to the user regarding specific molecular alterations potentially causative of disease.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> To address this, we investigate protein features underlying loss-of-function genetic variation and develop a machine learning method, MutPred-LOF, for the discrimination of pathogenic and tolerated variants that can also generate hypotheses on specific molecular events disrupted by the variant. We investigate a large set of human variants derived from the Human Gene Mutation Database, ClinVar and the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Our prediction method shows an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.85 for all loss-of-function variants and 0.75 for proteins in which both pathogenic and neutral variants have been observed. We applied MutPred-LOF to a set of 1142 de novo vari3ants from neurodevelopmental disorders and find enrichment of pathogenic variants in affected individuals. Overall, our results highlight the potential of computational tools to elucidate causal mechanisms underlying loss of protein function in loss-of-function variants.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> http://mutpred.mutdb.org.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> predrag@indiana.edu.	33	14	i389	28882004		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx272	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882004	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i389/3953989	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx272.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMqnpjKB9J39q15FrEAgEQgIIBd8j1NyXoe1kJb42C7vjKIwShS6rYjgFSZfWnWlXe3wgUBICmB_60JyIVBS4ePZFXArKz7Vb45mVn-aiIuNaQdCkD087vNe8nmrPOlFLpDcpunX4Eif6bUfnvYLCX8NXezGPQ4LhZMWWRdUpWO362mJdc1cnusAF9i_-VdGA7hyrYJj1R7nlN9KoJFu9LPXcdJVo6ZwnCCRFSQp2cF0zpGZpnlREF_4pXioIC4nBT2S27GCiBvqk50nZDPkUqaTZv-mq79i0O15k5hJY14ECtfdgLU7TkbPP834kZ6CkjXDz35HSPS8r9PUadg3pUtcxYnMx0RJPzFED1qFK_H1Jp6lkXJEDRlIY0jaI0WJ8mDXKdW-G-CKzbpPoAgq-1T6a_UvvYlWPXxHMDEf_iNGhUh68g4Y66CECRsv-KDt1EwmbmYUegCRXHiFWQhMmIIcxvbZ8skxi-MsoY5yw2K_GpLzEaj6D7AerTsDd4iACdjIFRZ51_uybGwg		28882004.main.html	28882004.main.pdf

However, reconstructing this tree is challenging as most cancer sequencing uses bulk tumor tissue containing heterogeneous mixtures of cells.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We introduce P robabilistic A lgorithm for S omatic Tr ee I nference (PASTRI), a new algorithm for bulk-tumor sequencing data that clusters somatic mutations into clones and infers a phylogenetic tree that describes the evolutionary history of the tumor. PASTRI uses an importance sampling algorithm that combines a probabilistic model of DNA sequencing data with a enumeration algorithm based on the combinatorial constraints defined by the underlying phylogenetic tree. As a result, tree inference is fast, accurate and robust to noise. We demonstrate on simulated data that PASTRI outperforms other cancer phylogeny algorithms in terms of runtime and accuracy. On real data from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient, we show that a simple linear phylogeny better explains the data the complex branching phylogeny that was previously reported.

Exact out-of-equilibrium studies induce extreme computational demands, leading state-of-the-art methods to rely on approximated kinetics landscapes, obtained using sampling strategies that strive to generate the key landmarks of the landscape topology. However, such methods are impeded by a large level of redundancy within sampled sets. Such a redundancy is uninformative, and obfuscates important intermediate states, leading to an incomplete vision of RNA dynamics.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We introduce RNANR, a new set of algorithms for the exploration of RNA kinetics landscapes at the secondary structure level.

This role of AS, combined with the relation of aberrant splicing to malignant states, motivated two streams of research, experimental and computational. The first involves a myriad of techniques such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq to identify splicing regulators and their putative targets. The second involves probabilistic models, also known as splicing codes, which infer regulatory mechanisms and predict splicing outcome directly from genomic sequence. To date, these models have utilized only expression data. In this work, we address two related challenges: Can we improve on previous models for AS outcome prediction and can we integrate additional sources of data to improve predictions for AS regulatory factors.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We perform a detailed comparison of two previous modeling approaches, Bayesian and Deep Neural networks, dissecting the confounding effects of datasets and target functions. We then develop a new target function for AS prediction in exon skipping events and show it significantly improves model accuracy. Next, we develop a modeling framework that leverages transfer learning to incorporate CLIP-Seq, knockdown and over expression experiments, which are inherently noisy and suffer from missing values. Using several datasets involving key splice factors in mouse brain, muscle and heart we demonstrate both the prediction improvements and biological insights offered by our new models. Overall, the framework we propose offers a scalable integrative solution to improve splicing code modeling as vast amounts of relevant genomic data become available.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Code and data available at: majiq.biociphers.org/jha_et_al_2017/.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> yosephb@upenn.edu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i274	28882000		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx268	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882000	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i274/3953982	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx268.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMs0pN5l-svAx4Tx21AgEQgIIBd71knME8mQlfY-0mqzfM9wRJ860ayMm7f1V5uKtKu45GzAEPuAafoY9N0wbI7w7YRZgSjquS0lkqsHA3AvKc1yVe-T198EZ7Yp22wkIQRLnhpFJATKJ9e1M5kvDDG7GhbYL_IeBnAtzYT5J-i_4Y95DlRkDrarHWTdirqiWr21E4NL4bKRR0QMA5s4urA4ktWjyNHWqVHH_x7Z5wcb7dqM6BZT7uxmL4QxOqqPcR6El5e8Vjd_s8Ckb_26xznOAUHABjE6KlSmcGdloA1_Fd-dmtmGDCwI8EaXrraFYKMaRphzU67JhX7aeWP-jeCWMGcXSw_SEVqQKUhhT-Ylt81oZNAm_F5t4Wd8kE0ejEGlheqLEwkthTEgjYUV_g0iNM-rpR1dcKmt3fxyq27KHAJaEuk_rp7KogsEZRVUwGkdrWm22aFuIywJFNnSnX0TTxprWyt48zMqJvz9EAiWQeUaKrryvMJB7gb7ywIVmDFjEUz1Fuaq5IdA		28882000.main.html	28882000.main.pdf

A crucial step in transcript assembly is to accurately determine the splicing junctions and boundaries of the expressed transcripts from the reads alignment. In contrast to the splicing junctions that can be efficiently detected from spliced reads, the problem of identifying boundaries remains open and challenging, due to the fact that the signal related to boundaries is noisy and weak.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We present DeepBound, an effective approach to identify boundaries of expressed transcripts from RNA-seq reads alignment. In its core DeepBound employs deep convolutional neural fields to learn the hidden distributions and patterns of boundaries. To accurately model the transition probabilities and to solve the label-imbalance problem, we novelly incorporate the AUC (area under the curve) score into the optimizing objective function. To address the issue that deep probabilistic graphical models requires large number of labeled training samples, we propose to use simulated RNA-seq datasets to train our model. Through extensive experimental studies on both simulation datasets of two species and biological datasets, we show that DeepBound consistently and significantly outperforms the two existing methods.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> DeepBound is freely available at https://github.com/realbigws/DeepBound .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> mingfu.shao@cs.cmu.edu or realbigws@gmail.com.	33	14	i267	28881999		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx267	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881999	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i267/3953980	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx267.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMPq1NUK4DNwIxbAqTAgEQgIIBd48AaKe16pv1MDM_VSq_G872J_Pd0ELpR_Uc8uTJBMlIbX8YimqbbEZX-ePOcPMZpfPIPx0Nmp4S8gyE52qpFtOwxJQWPXCvlJxdx7sX-VA8Jmx5Hogl5_3tOYafdSuygBWjoSicDSSkzj0FaRTlA-a0x-ZO6CyuHW9x2bIsgMvWktPZ9Lj8Ic8F8m7lJAEAz1Fd3b0zyA6hMJ2ETOCyG1CzFisHNxvWS0nAOKDuCR9ZK9QJjmtuOCucR9VOjkFqi4T5XJXg3V_SC1IUbAYK8Es7gTIOKIpg7fxfyXU-dFAoDIMyw1ocokUF4oLP3ORRVBZQuRqClW7DUDrD-p1srsLU0KKUJ9KDfQY1-zpM9Z0-QLmhTAv7kHsuZq_d0Gagemb8wGSSWYkl91mVV2WUvrU9pUvjdcNISrXW9RcjjWOgxRP9g0LJ_hFy647PChhmf3QwL5j7TV-iHVPHlqw9m3eZwHSSNRVAUAFxIQ8tXMgM_rfR4DG_Sw		28881999.main.html	28881999.main.pdf

Although there are several computational models for accurate drug response prediction, these often lack the ability to infer which feature combinations are the most predictive, particularly for high-dimensional molecular datasets. As increasing amounts of diverse genome-wide data sources are becoming available, there is a need to build new computational models that can effectively combine these data sources and identify maximally predictive feature combinations.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We present a novel approach that leverages on systematic integration of data sources to identify response predictive features of multiple drugs. To solve the modeling task we implement a Bayesian linear regression method.

Conventional statistical methods are less than ideal because they either fail to select relevant genes, predict poorly, ignore the unknown interaction structure between genes, or are computationally intractable. Thus, the creation of new methods which can handle many expression measurements on relatively small numbers of patients while also uncovering gene-gene relationships and predicting well is desirable.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We develop a new technique for using the marginal relationship between gene expression measurements and patient survival outcomes to identify a small subset of genes which appear highly relevant for predicting survival, produce a low-dimensional embedding based on this small subset, and amplify this embedding with information from the remaining genes. We motivate our methodology by using gene expression measurements to predict survival time for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, illustrate the behavior of our methodology on carefully constructed synthetic examples, and test it on a number of other gene expression datasets.

This leads to considerably faster convergence of the optimization procedure, since each round of e.g. the EM algorithm, can execute much more quickly. However, these approximate factorizations of the likelihood function simplify calculations at the expense of discarding certain information that can be useful for accurate transcript abundance estimation.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We demonstrate that model simplifications (i.e. factorizations of the likelihood function) adopted by certain abundance estimation methods can lead to a diminished ability to accurately estimate the abundances of highly related transcripts. In particular, considering factorizations based on transcript-fragment compatibility alone can result in a loss of accuracy compared to the per-fragment, unsimplified model. However, we show that such shortcomings are not an inherent limitation of approximately factorizing the underlying likelihood function. By considering the appropriate conditional fragment probabilities, and adopting improved, data-driven factorizations of this likelihood, we demonstrate that such approaches can achieve accuracy nearly indistinguishable from methods that consider the complete (i.e. per-fragment) likelihood, while retaining the computational efficiently of the compatibility-based factorizations.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Our data-driven factorizations are incorporated into a branch of the Salmon transcript quantification tool: https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/factorizations .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> rob.patro@cs.stonybrook.edu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i142	28881996		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx262	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881996	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i142/3953977	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx262.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM6wiDHo0acRC1iEwFAgEQgIIBdx6ehln6PuXU1mNMehT03yuU0g7k4Ib-Il3kLQKp8y9TtmqotCpV60Cng7VAqc4arknkZXAU_XCGCTavAwgtPO6Tg1agZDLVVtNSdQZqcdMT6WKSaEpGNN4P_Ju-vE6f5mT4pOL0tNc5aWDwvHuOseesW0vtWbZ-sFbipB2D4RzanOu2R4JdPRZbvMGqPt_pup7ggs0JVba0zwHK3auF8-_2bWPeRHiiJoNZ_oN2Z8aFkvcBvd7QjpcFch_DcGcKcAyeQcAic9OAqFCQ6ORrO2iqICUUukK-P7GLMHskzYXR4irXAeExiYs3fUPaX7xxMD1yuEpxPjExjH3inhPoUHrSUbF4qNjkzm_Xbsx7H9pS7gyNWx5xxN-KWO16FEIGp_674VFG0FvNBIedhk73xzVeXO1c43zX6pR5bQ10TaqSr2UB6fwn0c0ZUuh6AV8qAkgF2risc_EbMF5W6HhOb-uM-ucWk3Ql56QldGZ-0fHVqO11jMYoDg		28881996.main.html	28881996.main.pdf

Even when other approaches are used for subsequent assembly (e.g. when one is using 'long read' technologies like those offered by PacBio or Oxford Nanopore), efficient k -mer processing is still crucial for accurate assembly, and state-of-the-art long-read error-correction methods use de Bruijn Graphs. Because of the centrality of de Bruijn Graphs, researchers have proposed numerous methods for representing de Bruijn Graphs compactly. Some of these proposals sacrifice accuracy to save space. Further, none of these methods store abundance information, i.e. the number of times that each k -mer occurs, which is key in transcriptome assemblers.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We present a method for compactly representing the weighted de Bruijn Graph (i.e. with abundance information) with essentially no errors. Our representation yields zero errors while increasing the space requirements by less than 18-28% compared to the approximate de Bruijn graph representation in Squeakr. Our technique is based on a simple invariant that all weighted de Bruijn Graphs must satisfy, and hence is likely to be of general interest and applicable in most weighted de Bruijn Graph-based systems.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> https://github.com/splatlab/debgr .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> rob.patro@cs.stonybrook.edu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i133	28881995		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx261	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881995	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i133/3953976	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx261.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMVb9VU2u84iqGfzxCAgEQgIIBd7gO1EUy6NxqaFuzVwhrsC7iDAc6euaXKx7c9vu6bMvCL9qRxy-C1Ubg8L4Z-c7x4Qe59NGq1PexhYE4GmDo7u_5_bBXT0oaVY00q3KwoI8slb16wG0RJL2gTMDVDpw_SPR31mxevvOOI0Jumd6pSvCS4VBvEet_LM0ORDW5n64LHQRIkMhHZp6o0E4bgdxjkQiUHu8gWIzkY51FHOeXxT2BOgCo8n11Q4Kv_cl_6OmhtTYNofpWOoiHNVB0umVuO7evxVhRekeWtGnauSbKP4guV6Tu0iayCjK3zmAaxEtMQ0UusK9W94YZ2ALCanp86YJmploCv7PY-mtArbYJ3Yrbkb03haVzIEEer3yNeDqJ4VB99bb0V35ISpekPf44qz1EI-W6JdMg5ch_wZQTiiIW4CP8zh1qqy_ZSOC5qo4qYJGnmNBkCJ4xCArhm-8-h0tEgH8ZdxKdS7_akiDN7JpkJ6dZwQK7PBaiF1Dk8VkX7AKn2-zQhg		28881995.main.html	28881995.main.pdf

An increasingly common approach to gain insights from these large-scale profiling experiments involves the application of statistical learning methods to predict disease states or the immune response to perturbations. However, the goal of many systems studies is not to maximize accuracy, but rather to gain biological insights. The predictors identified using current approaches can be biologically uninterpretable or present only one of many equally predictive models, leading to a narrow understanding of the underlying biology.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Here we show that incorporating prior biological knowledge within a logistic modeling framework by using network-level constraints on transcriptional profiling data significantly improves interpretability. Moreover, incorporating different types of biological knowledge produces models that highlight distinct aspects of the underlying biology, while maintaining predictive accuracy. We propose a new framework, Logistic Multiple Network-constrained Regression (LogMiNeR), and apply it to understand the mechanisms underlying differential responses to influenza vaccination. Although standard logistic regression approaches were predictive, they were minimally interpretable. Incorporating prior knowledge using LogMiNeR led to models that were equally predictive yet highly interpretable. In this context, B cell-specific genes and mTOR signaling were associated with an effective vaccination response in young adults. Overall, our results demonstrate a new paradigm for analyzing high-dimensional immune profiling data in which multiple networks encoding prior knowledge are incorporated to improve model interpretability.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> The R source code described in this article is publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/kleinstein/logminer .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> steven.kleinstein@yale.edu or stefan.avey@yale.edu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i208	28881994		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx260	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881994	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i208/3953975	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx260.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcMwggG_BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGwMIIBrAIBADCCAaUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMt1OrdZmcgNuvkEARAgEQgIIBdvBMJVh-wsqfYGap7bd4EZQ3KOISSc0-oLQOi9nLP7QCzs-wQn8yExUVbG4VhBscBqJK0cIU9rvc0My-ejGWEeX8RdTp-u7gkZQ4bFObVf2z2b0idLgSd5myEeovMbdPoALUJuBrAcQ1qPNISlIiWEdVWwCVi66vq3E4zwtgyaat8meSFnnzF9_nLlSrAuucuDWJv5yj8ifQTLc9TtlNE77xyEaepCpNL0nopurVwlJJSfSVKGi5ObbXgT-RjajScU64QoLYbaEQ9NP4RQLJ1o19qDRu896MgMQ9xVn599af-n9wQ8sTrFnZlr7GSfZ1SV9fpgGBRJL76KxpgG_fj1nD1NGOJrsxUfINwyWRN6A_wvLLB4Lfshncli3q2LCztZyQlqLrK4DmFWnTDZkEgM6W5TFG-38ylpi22Ei4GC7I2prs5ARRjOTRTdIbJXqf6xjT6kmJWs9gKwBgG5j8bwoz0JGvSiVUhvG2JOAolDUIJcuol4E1		28881994.main.html	28881994.main.pdf

For the purpose of fully understanding the impact of WGD, several formal algorithms have been developed for reconstructing pre-WGD gene order in yeast and plant. However, to the best of our knowledge, those algorithms have never been successfully applied to WGD events in teleost and vertebrate, impeded by extensive gene shuffling and gene losses.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Here, we present a probabilistic model of macrosynteny (i.e. conserved linkage or chromosome-scale distribution of orthologs), develop a variational Bayes algorithm for inferring the structure of pre-WGD genomes, and study estimation accuracy by simulation. Then, by applying the method to the teleost WGD, we demonstrate effectiveness of the algorithm in a situation where gene-order reconstruction algorithms perform relatively poorly due to a high rate of rearrangement and extensive gene losses. Our high-resolution reconstruction reveals previously overlooked small-scale rearrangements, necessitating a revision to previous views on genome structure evolution in teleost and vertebrate.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We have reconstructed the structure of a pre-WGD genome by employing a variational Bayes approach that was originally developed for inferring topics from millions of text documents. Interestingly, comparison of the macrosynteny and topic model algorithms suggests that macrosynteny can be regarded as documents on ancestral genome structure.

One such example is the interaction between microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA), whose deregulation may be sensitive to environmental insult leading to altered phenotypes. The goal of this work is to develop an effective data integration method to characterize deregulation between miRNA and mRNA due to environmental toxicant exposures. We will use data from an animal experiment designed to investigate the effect of low-dose environmental chemical exposure on normal mammary gland development in rats to motivate and evaluate the proposed method.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We propose a new network approach-integrative Joint Random Forest (iJRF), which characterizes the regulatory system between miRNAs and mRNAs using a network model. iJRF is designed to work under the high-dimension low-sample-size regime, and can borrow information across different treatment conditions to achieve more accurate network inference. It also effectively takes into account prior information of miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships from existing databases. When iJRF is applied to the data from the environmental chemical exposure study, we detected a few important miRNAs that regulated a large number of mRNAs in the control group but not in the exposed groups, suggesting the disruption of miRNA activity due to chemical exposure. Effects of chemical exposure on two affected miRNAs were further validated using breast cancer human cell lines.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> R package iJRF is available at CRAN.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> pei.wang@mssm.edu or susan.teitelbaum@mssm.edu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i199	28881990		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx256	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881990	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i199/3953971	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx256.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMkaSkOD9NbhsCEkbVAgEQgIIBd3RnTa4NtlA1hoPbqQAdEhD9Eexmy9qUSgo2i9KbJNGwh5D0tH0a_QwIkCjwjE0nuVj9yd5KgHT3wdoVlQTgUW7KUqCv6bBZYUcWZAecPJT_8nmsXVSCMv3Rn_3kBCp21XMwKKQXGhLHpR2fAACUDD3fjuvy-R8BcEezCw8WWLJzIQtFAt6Ai_30yQnYo-rBJwYThwKPa539bg8hlF-XjkmbBGv3vU8MivkHeOwCTdHoFqVGb3HMhx9YxIjDUB6y2KKoM_MABvqnYrUM_QdAQH09ho5lIxNPNwJM7PqT3k2eLDnqglyXkeOG0pDaCsqNgI0fqaW04KKHHDDT-UWvp4AyZdWN_2pi_Gv7XxWFfKMV35cfbRkEnTyzdtvk9mLes7Yh96-S-iYb3SxHx9TSDLoeERW1RHaMGWGnf3XhmwAwAcM_d8EcBs_ASOh0IB5wNM0r5bbpZWxxnikZZmaThKP7R6ZxEgONCAZ6Qp2RYEadAiHZSgP94g		28881990.main.html	28881990.main.pdf

Among the huge amount of computational approaches for de novo identification of TFBS motifs, discriminative motif learning (DML) methods have been proven to be promising for harnessing the discovery power of accumulated huge amount of high-throughput binding data. However, they have to sacrifice accuracy for speed and could fail to fully utilize the information of the input sequences.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We propose a novel algorithm called CDAUC for optimizing DML-learned motifs based on the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) criterion, which has been widely used in the literature to evaluate the significance of extracted motifs. We show that when the considered AUC loss function is optimized in a coordinate-wise manner, the cost function of each resultant sub-problem is a piece-wise constant function, whose optimal value can be found exactly and efficiently. Further, a key step of each iteration of CDAUC can be efficiently solved as a computational geometry problem. Experimental results on real world high-throughput datasets illustrate that CDAUC outperforms competing methods for refining DML motifs, while being one order of magnitude faster. Meanwhile, preliminary results also show that CDAUC may also be useful for improving the interpretability of convolutional kernels generated by the emerging deep learning approaches for predicting TF sequences specificities.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> CDAUC is available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxOW5MtIZbJjNFpCeHlBVWJHeW8 .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> dshuang@tongji.edu.cn.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i243	28881989		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx255	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881989	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017		http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/production_in_progress.pdf			28881989.main.pdf

This is mainly due to both computational difficulties and the complexities imposed by genomic repeats in generating reliable assemblies to accurately detect both the sequence content and the exact location of such insertions. Additionally, de novo genome assembly algorithms typically require a very high depth of coverage, which may be a limiting factor for most genome studies. Therefore, characterization of novel sequence insertions is not a routine part of most sequencing projects.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Here, we present Pamir, a new algorithm to efficiently and accurately discover and genotype novel sequence insertions using either single or multiple genome sequencing datasets. Pamir is able to detect breakpoint locations of the insertions and calculate their zygosity (i.e. heterozygous versus homozygous) by analyzing multiple sequence signatures, matching one-end-anchored sequences to small-scale de novo assemblies of unmapped reads, and conducting strand-aware local assembly. We test the efficacy of Pamir on both simulated and real data, and demonstrate its potential use in accurate and routine identification of novel sequence insertions in genome projects.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Pamir is available at https://github.com/vpc-ccg/pamir .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> fhach@{sfu.ca, prostatecentre.com } or calkan@cs.bilkent.edu.tr.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i161	28881988		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx254	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881988	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i161/3953969	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx254.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcMwggG_BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGwMIIBrAIBADCCAaUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM-EwgXtVy-3cRN7U-AgEQgIIBdtVhWrg-zyVdP1pqRkfIj6Jbib1Yksql9vZWx17eX8WgdvmZ2K-gbiRAH4Ui2XuBOKL1xGjIDsQq17BRDt9UdZT30XtqBFZm6SSY6eb-NtjHX31_1obQCvsn66FKhtYjlmvplSD20UMvceDx9vr-wUlw68TRvK4bMC9nbPIq-VZJWU3W2osqDXWvjEhgLtrYdZfKXbUqZMnmF7UlzPANKz7n3yjt0qoc-3hbrspqVBwk38RHBLdgqz7wxmfVh9slPTpIwMdZlHbWaJc9izwKxLj2ajNN_HKaRG0XlhpoW4tjWBcGNmQTheHAJqGuACgs_tZaA-ZGBDIRRdro95HGzn74e-EZBt2HjN2PP__phTSM1RoWginamClo4kfw2-UiAfx3pvZdXc7fmaAr2YdelOKlgEyA4mvNlqD4w2QaGSJruvOmBKGokMLU-Um0sHSHBxOQOIfXRhPKz_ZhmY3__aAjwDBwPfuu5eKBsV2I6c3AdjsDJYjm		28881988.main.html	28881988.main.pdf

Stochastic effects must be taken into account to characterize biochemical kinetics accurately. Since the exact solution of the chemical master equation, which governs the underlying stochastic process, cannot be derived for most biochemical systems, approximate methods are used to obtain a solution.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> In this study, a method to efficiently simulate the various sources of noise simultaneously is proposed and benchmarked on several examples.

The comparison of our method to extensive Monte Carlo calculations demonstrates an immense computational advantage while losing an acceptable amount of accuracy.

We build a multi-layer network, where each layer represents molecular interactions in a different human tissue. OhmNet then automatically learns a mapping of proteins, represented as nodes, to a neural embedding-based low-dimensional space of features. OhmNet encourages sharing of similar features among proteins with similar network neighborhoods and among proteins activated in similar tissues. The algorithm generalizes prior work, which generally ignores relationships between tissues, by modeling tissue organization with a rich multiscale tissue hierarchy. We use OhmNet to study multicellular function in a multi-layer protein interaction network of 107 human tissues. In 48 tissues with known tissue-specific cellular functions, OhmNet provides more accurate predictions of cellular function than alternative approaches, and also generates more accurate hypotheses about tissue-specific protein actions. We show that taking into account the tissue hierarchy leads to improved predictive power. Remarkably, we also demonstrate that it is possible to leverage the tissue hierarchy in order to effectively transfer cellular functions to a functionally uncharacterized tissue.

From these data, it is possible to compute the rates of uptake and excretion of the metabolites by a growing cell population, providing precious information on the functioning of intracellular metabolism. The computation of the rate of these exchange reactions, however, is difficult to achieve in practice for a number of reasons, notably noisy measurements, correlations between the concentration profiles of the different extracellular metabolites, and discontinuties in the profiles due to sudden changes in metabolic regime.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We present a method for precisely estimating time-varying uptake and excretion rates from time-series measurements of extracellular metabolite concentrations, specifically addressing all of the above issues. The estimation problem is formulated in a regularized Bayesian framework and solved by a combination of extended Kalman filtering and smoothing. The method is shown to improve upon methods based on spline smoothing of the data. Moreover, when applied to two actual datasets, the method recovers known features of overflow metabolism in Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis , and provides evidence for acetate uptake by L. lactis after glucose exhaustion.

Their dynamics are often described by continuous-time discrete-state Markov chains and simulated using stochastic simulation algorithms. As these stochastic simulations are computationally demanding, ordinary differential equation models for the dynamics of the statistical moments have been developed. The number of state variables of these approximating models, however, grows at least quadratically with the number of biochemical species. This limits their application to small- and medium-sized processes.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> In this article, we present a scalable moment-closure approximation (sMA) for the simulation of statistical moments of large-scale stochastic processes. The sMA exploits the structure of the biochemical reaction network to reduce the covariance matrix. We prove that sMA yields approximating models whose number of state variables depends predominantly on local properties, i.e. the average node degree of the reaction network, instead of the overall network size.

The rapid emergence of bisulfite-sequencing technologies enables performing such genome-wide studies at the resolution of single nucleotides. However, analysis of data produced by bisulfite-sequencing poses statistical challenges owing to low and uneven sequencing depth, as well as the presence of confounding factors. The recently introduced Mixed model Association for Count data via data AUgmentation (MACAU) can address these challenges via a generalized linear mixed model when confounding can be encoded via a single variance component. However, MACAU cannot be used in the presence of multiple variance components. Additionally, MACAU uses a computationally expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure, which cannot directly approximate the model likelihood.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We present a new method, Mixed model Association via a Laplace ApproXimation (MALAX), that is more computationally efficient than MACAU and allows to model multiple variance components. MALAX uses a Laplace approximation rather than MCMC based approximations, which enables to directly approximate the model likelihood. Through an extensive analysis of simulated and real data, we demonstrate that MALAX successfully addresses statistical challenges introduced by bisulfite-sequencing while controlling for complex sources of confounding, and can be over 50% faster than the state of the art.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> The full source code of MALAX is available at https://github.com/omerwe/MALAX .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> omerw@cs.technion.ac.il or ehalperin@cs.ucla.edu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i325	28881982		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx248	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881982	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i325/3953963	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx248.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMZbCNm7IO24WZP51MAgEQgIIBd2g44slmrFC32jV3aMPEwU-ERARZmhcQ_vL67cQqu7Abky6SID_5yv99exqLPdAO9vmGuzxo8yoD2kpcFoKlBgnZF33Giy4cOmy5uOsc0sNfreRzwibqoU9dT3KvXHkJ7P8zBY8HnBQoyxusHMDSwyJbkowu6KJAvmg4piDuKYexZYtR3CQDxbaNsHct9bhgmq8Sw44JmZL4Ze2Z2703ugtbtzNByOKAcGJ_xvYZqtf9AhejutBT2ZqrJLME4sJd3tJQMlyMros7l809YGc0xgLeUMppW1BTpPuVFFKXOYFMgvojOP4a0UTj8NuODE9rTwiTxQxTRSwyY7d4LYaRkVPsxSxai5zcw2KlyZYOTdhwRDLHqX4Y1SLRqjrMVJ33F0DHq5rmMnPJxc50WgbGbTDGNVgXK1jzt7vSdrZHdpU4YbcG3aLbnj1AP_uGCkzAt4NewgA6FHY2eieeAeSqNRra0KO-e66LJ2mgKZoK5kA7Okvy-1wPWw		28881982.main.html	28881982.main.pdf

In addition to the annotated translation initiation sites (TISs), the translation process may also start at multiple alternative TISs (including both AUG and non-AUG codons), which makes it challenging to predict TISs and study the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile, the advent of several high-throughput sequencing techniques for profiling initiating ribosomes at single-nucleotide resolution, e.g. GTI-seq and QTI-seq, provides abundant data for systematically studying the general principles of translation initiation and the development of computational method for TIS identification.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We have developed a deep learning-based framework, named TITER, for accurately predicting TISs on a genome-wide scale based on QTI-seq data. TITER extracts the sequence features of translation initiation from the surrounding sequence contexts of TISs using a hybrid neural network and further integrates the prior preference of TIS codon composition into a unified prediction framework.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Extensive tests demonstrated that TITER can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art prediction methods in identifying TISs. In addition, TITER was able to identify important sequence signatures for individual types of TIS codons, including a Kozak-sequence-like motif for AUG start codon. Furthermore, the TITER prediction score can be related to the strength of translation initiation in various biological scenarios, including the repressive effect of the upstream open reading frames on gene expression and the mutational effects influencing translation initiation efficiency.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> TITER is available as an open-source software and can be downloaded from https://github.com/zhangsaithu/titer .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> lzhang20@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn or zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i234	28881981		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx247	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881981	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i234/3953962	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx247.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMEkodf1cVdmluJmd7AgEQgIIBd6dRh-1Qe-_Rwb60nUKLcS7P7DAAPVhIzmS_x89hynyqrOJ_58Ycvl0hscoNTTId7FQ2OxMXMzMzqEzEbLOow75G56DU14Kx1YZJoOhT489K2NjrK0ALjwDPU0ajlpxkKnw8Vp9ZrwoRwl_pw0ExJl449tYo_xOQ6NRQMd6Ye1H3fGnJSJGBYuqv7iwiJpI98bPOtbZX7zG1QGxDx7sGBiQc0WW2o9238zezWwZSW4FvpcGP5HH6kUnuhe-wxJx-89nAlV8pC8I2GXxFonk82nOxPMaMK_Z4AutONeYUbz3n1IDwjqcPdV7niuZFCfpXNNlk5e_hEofQa5JmhXMlkjp8fH34pkWjN_GKj63-wLsIeByhCTtETK8UervHcctb1pJZ34ZShENMpxoGye6M-k9tojI1qfaOc-ZtfycfT_KDsLbDr7ZwdwpS4z2-meEefqtdr63U8JXxgNG6fZv7NF_O92Klwwd73OOQiu5Sj3nxLk_PBxuE_g		28881981.main.html	28881981.main.pdf

NA is applicable to many fields, including computational biology, where NA can guide the transfer of biological knowledge from well- to poorly-studied species across aligned network regions. Existing NA methods can only align static networks. However, most complex real-world systems evolve over time and should thus be modeled as dynamic networks. We hypothesize that aligning dynamic network representations of evolving systems will produce superior alignments compared to aligning the systems' static network representations, as is currently done.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> For this purpose, we introduce the first ever dynamic NA method, DynaMAGNA ++. This proof-of-concept dynamic NA method is an extension of a state-of-the-art static NA method, MAGNA++. Even though both MAGNA++ and DynaMAGNA++ optimize edge as well as node conservation across the aligned networks, MAGNA++ conserves static edges and similarity between static node neighborhoods, while DynaMAGNA++ conserves dynamic edges (events) and similarity between evolving node neighborhoods. For this purpose, we introduce the first ever measure of dynamic edge conservation and rely on our recent measure of dynamic node conservation. Importantly, the two dynamic conservation measures can be optimized with any state-of-the-art NA method and not just MAGNA++. We confirm our hypothesis that dynamic NA is superior to static NA, on synthetic and real-world networks, in computational biology and social domains. DynaMAGNA++ is parallelized and has a user-friendly graphical interface.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> http://nd.edu/∼cone/DynaMAGNA++/ .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> tmilenko@nd.edu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i180	28881980		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx246	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881980	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i180/3953961	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx246.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMiqqf5RJCpCOsFHOiAgEQgIIBd3IY9ga-kKc_2-a7xibXCHqrsPbILyQK7kIv9Xej7mEI_bgxlUcXQE3dms7KWx3J1Y-Lx_86Xra5J8J7P4KSu21ScSePYR7lLv7SaPSZx5o1tjCHnlO21P2eA8nbTP92tciyjgbUqYiUjj6laY4gQxITyDeN8EX3e5eJ6-lzKmYRNDMywuhcQ_6BCV7xexSv1zoOZk2rwPtVaVUsIT5RdG98vPAWcp-Hei9zAc7SRuDBfkRfPddlpwp2gSnxGHsU2pVMwupZ0BnqjGpbtupPP5M1Oy-Gs9XyfWSpqnSUHcNyTxoUkpWNTHYcgu_dxPTixp2JApXA299m_n7F-wnDsbertf5U9V2OEpJQy2PfQkBRpWekNbuJdCbSTg-18qo-7aBhLLcKhG1NaGtQ0f5_DEvpMJL-1Tbcm9TL3_3yvNgyiDXvVpyIpRKilPMNdbnGmmv4iXXy8fJni0SU5hJMs_v6sykZw1NGbVfVXHTHePMuMulkZ0BfFw		28881980.main.html	28881980.main.pdf

So far, most existing machine-learning approaches are widely used to detect the effective associations between genetic variants and brain imaging data at one time-point. However, those associations are based on static phenotypes and ignore the temporal dynamics of the phenotypical changes. The phenotypes across multiple time-points may exhibit temporal patterns that can be used to facilitate the understanding of the degenerative process. In this article, we propose a novel temporally constrained group sparse canonical correlation analysis (TGSCCA) framework to identify genetic associations with longitudinal phenotypic markers.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> The proposed TGSCCA method is able to capture the temporal changes in brain from longitudinal phenotypes by incorporating the fused penalty, which requires that the differences between two consecutive canonical weight vectors from adjacent time-points should be small. A new efficient optimization algorithm is designed to solve the objective function. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on both synthetic and real data (i.e., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort, including progressive mild cognitive impairment, stable MCI and Normal Control participants). In comparison with conventional SCCA, our proposed method can achieve strong associations and discover phenotypic biomarkers across multiple time-points to guide disease-progressive interpretation.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> The Matlab code is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibrain-cn/files/ .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> dqzhang@nuaa.edu.cn or shenli@iu.edu.	33	14	i341	28881979		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx245	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881979	Wed Dec 20 23:09:15 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i341/3953960	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx245.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM5vygn6KO429a2IJNAgEQgIIBdwsD8FsWqXsY-rg5c2xGlub_TtqHWhVsOVQmkUeCUcbbjZoJ7PdroRZEKlNpTLfEV736w5A3SS2jGraunK_iYy17QCVs7MEAjzotFLODN2Q078Qt-N5ZVZ9s0Y1WwMbOsZ9eR2i_BSm7DYABlWjME1uUuBSF8Te713VBqGm2XQ_XP_SOntMECeEQzHpu0lra4BdN00HVfdfWKJyY4D_u5a8fQDiRTB-FpJet-CJnKctDqmPo5XSGuku33xoeGSv2T_NPvGnBp-fBQG1ksGF7hblyLR9MJ_isVzfjKQojLtBRtBl_rxajmMaR0f013f2ugfTy-sVhaS7lk64tKcLXlk91-bwTHlztY5TLoXoTDoSEUcQjLVk5CfSThrwduIzxn7Nb2yejS3i9SrOymddgVcFVhAfxQvc6LAUAAj73b6NVpyx1ISMDgfOgx_kvPJqQGMeAA5coWZLyP6-oFXhaeBFv0sDxMaZVv7nTSkAB5lK08CQsMMbdBw		28881979.main.html	28881979.main.pdf

Recent large-scale meta-analyses have combined studies of different ethnicities, environments and even studies of different related phenotypes. These differences between studies can manifest as effect size heterogeneity. We previously developed a modified random effects model (RE2) that can achieve higher power to detect heterogeneous effects than the commonly used fixed effects model (FE). However, RE2 cannot perform meta-analysis of correlated statistics, which are found in recent research designs, and the identified variants often overlap with those found by FE.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Here, we propose RE2C, which increases the power of RE2 in two ways. First, we generalized the likelihood model to account for correlations of statistics to achieve optimal power, using an optimization technique based on spectral decomposition for efficient parameter estimation. Second, we designed a novel statistic to focus on the heterogeneous effects that FE cannot detect, thereby, increasing the power to identify new associations. We developed an efficient and accurate p -value approximation procedure using analytical decomposition of the statistic. In simulations, RE2C achieved a dramatic increase in power compared with the decoupling approach (71% vs. 21%) when the statistics were correlated. Even when the statistics are uncorrelated, RE2C achieves a modest increase in power. Applications to real genetic data supported the utility of RE2C.

A statistical model that assumes independent sample and feature effects accounted for 69-94% of technical variability. We analyzed how variability is propagated through linear signatures possibly affecting predictions and treatment recommendations. Linear signatures with feature weights adding to zero were substantially more robust than unbalanced signatures.

Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) applications are becoming increasingly important to facilitate the retrieval and analysis of these data. Computing the semantic similarity between sentences is an important component in many NLP tasks including text retrieval and summarization. A number of approaches have been proposed for semantic sentence similarity estimation for generic English. However, our experiments showed that such approaches do not effectively cover biomedical knowledge and produce poor results for biomedical text.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We propose several approaches for sentence-level semantic similarity computation in the biomedical domain, including string similarity measures and measures based on the distributed vector representations of sentences learned in an unsupervised manner from a large biomedical corpus. In addition, ontology-based approaches are presented that utilize general and domain-specific ontologies. Finally, a supervised regression based model is developed that effectively combines the different similarity computation metrics. A benchmark data set consisting of 100 sentence pairs from the biomedical literature is manually annotated by five human experts and used for evaluating the proposed methods.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> The experiments showed that the supervised semantic sentence similarity computation approach obtained the best performance (0.836 correlation with gold standard human annotations) and improved over the state-of-the-art domain-independent systems up to 42.6% in terms of the Pearson correlation metric.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> A web-based system for biomedical semantic sentence similarity computation, the source code, and the annotated benchmark data set are available at: http://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/BIOSSES/ .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> gizemsogancioglu@gmail.com or arzucan.ozgur@boun.edu.tr.	33	14	i49	28881973		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx238	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881973	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i49/3953954	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx238.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcMwggG_BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGwMIIBrAIBADCCAaUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMqmUoxazDEQPbrsW2AgEQgIIBdkUT27N07cYAkur2I8JddhuoqDzPVfrGc5PrsCs4p5fXfxhxCLjpUBbtTqa9OQlbsJgExLn4yovk2uA_codBFza5cIDb9UAa1JumUhiwYtW3HhAnbMbfGHeS6iJ5gDCVKHUAPv5_TBLZe_PbQ2dduGozWYh2vcJUX5zQImwcCG3feBHTQAXq5cZ76d29FLDoDOB7Dr7jQoYoxnt7YhqdXF9zLA1yownXN7-Ow0u-Ili9MgXr7BQczycztoKzC74JyYINoOIaWkuKz7nYAM5J1bTC4OyAbzhUmp6YPf1teLrsHlr2eeKFHT-rBjyD9OAMm1M1ENidsE3ChK6EPabJBB4CH23OG5RBylrINf5V5xVQlJKqzEjhkafKz8O4ZAfH2Y51ooTM3c-Z80Mbl0Wov4G1CFBaxCL_wO36hAP0XzBz4MtSR_5i6bO0zGttacUoWkI1DKNFnq-9wwPSQ4PwxC6RCBiDloGBfYtAiHPP5fLiY_WUE97n		28881973.main.html	28881973.main.pdf

Important changes to the composition are known to even occur on strain level and to go hand in hand with changes in disease or ecological state. However, specific challenges arise for strain level analysis due to highly similar genome sequences present. Only a limited number of tools approach taxa abundance estimation beyond species level and there is a strong need for dedicated tools for strain resolution and differential abundance testing.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We present DiTASiC ( fferential axa bundance including milarity orrection) as a novel approach for quantification and differential assessment of individual taxa in metagenomics samples. We introduce a generalized linear model for the resolution of shared read counts which cause a significant bias on strain level. Further, we capture abundance estimation uncertainties, which play a crucial role in differential abundance analysis. A novel statistical framework is built, which integrates the abundance variance and infers abundance distributions for differential testing sensitive to strain level.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> As a result, we obtain highly accurate abundance estimates down to sub-strain level and enable fine-grained resolution of strain clusters. We demonstrate the relevance of read ambiguity resolution and integration of abundance uncertainties for differential analysis. Accurate detections of even small changes are achieved and false-positives are significantly reduced.

It is used in many bioinformatics software tools to bin comparable sequences or to sample a sequence in a deterministic fashion at approximately regular intervals, in order to reduce memory consumption and processing time. Although very useful, the minimizers selection procedure has undesirable behaviors (e.g. too many k -mers are selected when processing certain sequences). Some of these problems were already known to the authors of the minimizers technique, and the natural lexicographic ordering of k -mers used by minimizers was recognized as their origin. Many software tools using minimizers employ ad hoc variations of the lexicographic order to alleviate those issues.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of k -mer ordering on the performance of the minimizers technique. By using small universal hitting sets (a recently defined concept), we show how to significantly improve the performance of minimizers and avoid some of its worse behaviors. Based on these results, we encourage bioinformatics software developers to use an ordering based on a universal hitting set or, if not possible, a randomized ordering, rather than the lexicographic order. This analysis also settles negatively a conjecture (by Schleimer et al. ) on the expected density of minimizers in a random sequence.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> The software used for this analysis is available on GitHub: https://github.com/gmarcais/minimizers.git .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> gmarcais@cs.cmu.edu or carlk@cs.cmu.edu.	33	14	i110	28881970		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx235	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881970	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i110/3953951	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx235.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMQu-3DhrPwxbwjyWSAgEQgIIBd5PHfnFlQhAZ7XDbvhwU7O0JlvGncpiPWNSVf8Ygias0hsQUd0UyudhqOsnWzQxp-OaqLoSTa-NJ2cogJuFPjQJwehODbInsz0wm50OZMWyE2MgN6NLayfo6tphnDLBaTqc2YKu-FsnTTJ5uhEBAQ2SBLDm4Fe2gpExhNq5Tp4LSAfhXTd_mZLLkxiPrz_dS074PzeGlydridoOd20PEekL4jrERMPrRzdf8Q20xyBRujSaWYgaPHPWW5RerySqfJ3IYvaPUDApiLiKckXS4c2WH9EDB2Q41HSWuUOWURUO9qm3X0sAIuOC_roGQ3nLp4Xa6A6BdO6qA-CHIoWt8dEgFIUh9TojvKmhCX04IFMtdM55nk22fbVLeD3eMDCEvtvVBAi0uxXIRxqNZAZ0wwNLuGoMVM8GQgVS3ZQ47k6HJH1Tt7_crbSYZjWrEkGloM_fs3TW8c_7UMkSQegfWMHNy9p3ShCzZAy8EIdnhQmEDbLQsJly21g		28881970.main.html	28881970.main.pdf

Along this direction, existing methods fall into two classes: one based on handcrafted k -mer features and the other based on convolutional neural networks. Although both categories have shown good performance in specific applications thus far, there still lacks a comprehensive framework to integrate useful k -mer co-occurrence information with recent advances in deep learning.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We fill this gap by addressing the problem of chromatin accessibility prediction with a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with k -mer embedding. We first split DNA sequences into k -mers and pre-train k -mer embedding vectors based on the co-occurrence matrix of k -mers by using an unsupervised representation learning approach. We then construct a supervised deep learning architecture comprised of an embedding layer, three convolutional layers and a Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) layer for feature learning and classification. We demonstrate that our method gains high-quality fixed-length features from variable-length sequences and consistently outperforms baseline methods. We show that k -mer embedding can effectively enhance model performance by exploring different embedding strategies. We also prove the efficacy of both the convolution and the BLSTM layers by comparing two variations of the network architecture.

The recovery of pseudotime increases the temporal resolution of single-cell transcriptional data, but is challenging due to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells.

MPs are gaining more attention in recent years as they are found to play important roles in various systems including disease developments. MPs also have a significant impact in computational function prediction and annotation in databases. Currently MPs are not labeled as such in biological databases even in cases where multiple distinct functions are known for the proteins. In this work, we propose a novel method named DextMP, which predicts whether a protein is a MP or not based on its textual features extracted from scientific literature and the UniProt database.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> DextMP extracts three categories of textual information for a protein: titles, abstracts from literature, and function description in UniProt. Three language models were applied and compared: a state-of-the-art deep unsupervised learning algorithm along with two other language models of different types, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency in the bag-of-words and Latent Dirichlet Allocation in the topic modeling category. Cross-validation results on a dataset of known MPs and non-MPs showed that DextMP successfully predicted MPs with over 91% accuracy with significant improvement over existing MP prediction methods. Lastly, we ran DextMP with the best performing language models and text-based feature combinations on three genomes, human, yeast and Xenopus laevis , and found that about 2.5-35% of the proteomes are potential MPs.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Code available at http://kiharalab.org/DextMP .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> dkihara@purdue.edu.	33	14	i83	28881966		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx231	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881966	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i83/3953945	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx231.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcMwggG_BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGwMIIBrAIBADCCAaUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMX0IjjUf2WaLfRiRjAgEQgIIBdj8BLIT7XuietHQAGJ3TlmTto2GmpS8sGNqJMDh5YONqOtDk_l8tXJRI2wTb0nRP3I9CsOQ8tJh1OofeaBG6bT7Gquy3_6uHT-6ijWzrbpJDNBQcDPZbYISnS1KDd2aPTeryQQpMtqX1UZH7D6x5rLBER6RIU5p-sb1yMXcFhjXdxbDc8iXUcF78aSktj78Jn-7ceA3GZn_BP51_a-XJo2YTEJW5HDA7CwMJoj-JkLdCKEbj2K7TLsr879aCzA47fcjtSarzEORLa1DqMxCqzla2qKchD3zs_PbSo15KEcCvAaLcwqaqu_JIzITznaz_tvwVKS9xcdVeVel4MIjaLmcEsYLmArMjhHl-l_guv0mjUhH8W2kmugaX3QmMHZDpuJMIPYbddkYsOqMmnVUZ8Pj6G7HYN5m_q1Hx3Pzw6JbR9-yGByTXsz54pnY4zadVINRnbS5vsxl4_MRTnoYTJuTcSb-Kpgev5Mk8bNukKoQ3toF3yQBD		28881966.main.html	28881966.main.pdf

However, high degree of structural complexity together with practical imaging limitations makes the systematic de novo discovery of structures within cells challenging. It would likely require averaging and classifying millions of subtomograms potentially containing hundreds of highly heterogeneous structural classes. Although it is no longer difficult to acquire CECT data containing such amount of subtomograms due to advances in data acquisition automation, existing computational approaches have very limited scalability or discrimination ability, making them incapable of processing such amount of data.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> To complement existing approaches, in this article we propose a new approach for subdividing subtomograms into smaller but relatively homogeneous subsets. The structures in these subsets can then be separately recovered using existing computation intensive methods. Our approach is based on supervised structural feature extraction using deep learning, in combination with unsupervised clustering and reference-free classification. Our experiments show that, compared with existing unsupervised rotation invariant feature and pose-normalization based approaches, our new approach achieves significant improvements in both discrimination ability and scalability. More importantly, our new approach is able to discover new structural classes and recover structures that do not exist in training data.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Source code freely available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/∼mxu1/software .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> mxu1@cs.cmu.edu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	i13	28881965		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx230	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881965	Sat Dec  2 22:26:42 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i13/3953944	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx230.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcMwggG_BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGwMIIBrAIBADCCAaUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMxOlzfUR5g-QQnJQ8AgEQgIIBdpXpCfBTwVgVsuQiY9Tsii7TSnzCaOFBPL-eZD_LTwaAS7O-7W3yiry65Lbd5I8Imeh9ugHCS3MjZyNkdbC3fEvnKvraU7Xs6Jzbcz5Ef0FySe-Kq0KIcPM0GUPvg5Nh6twhMJ2t4pNJR7c3y_ll0_Cc_K0P26jqHGhhZEd3e6zLRc7MQM5JYLQaDJ1wS7WUW-i7aqZWdYCwNQB_QiNSMFA3T0t2ZU20KPhSLP970jlvXNmd_GRD_WZJ3H57RtYkbFXCf9LT9DZXC4JyMb04GPypVquWOVZRvHXIfumkcVU2JiRgLJzRGWRujzYplAk8NHcHH6yxprXe7EMQTo0pRWwzrlwD0QvLnSrJKpsroEEdKGJgYAnXBs7TwhKwFy2r8U0CjJ4XgQu6DrLhNhOacA-tQ9QW79_UeH1BWa5MdE7JIy4T15X9MFOKxV1ZT97sCq6in1VBzO8UduZSvBZuKAmpet6MF3bIKGiST53915FbgBkWst5E		28881965.main.html	28881965.main.pdf

Many methods have been proposed, including OMA (Orthologous MAtrix). Yet substantial challenges remain, in particular in coping with fragmented genes or genes evolving at different rates after duplication, and in scaling to large datasets. With more and more genomes available, it is necessary to improve the scalability and robustness of orthology inference methods.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We present improvements in the OMA algorithm: (i) refining the pairwise orthology inference step to account for same-species paralogs evolving at different rates, and (ii) minimizing errors in the pairwise orthology verification step by testing the consistency of pairwise distance estimates, which can be problematic in the presence of fragmentary sequences. In addition we introduce a more scalable procedure for hierarchical orthologous group (HOG) clustering, which are several orders of magnitude faster on large datasets. Using the Quest for Orthologs consortium orthology benchmark service, we show that these changes translate into substantial improvement on multiple empirical datasets.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> This new OMA 2.0 algorithm is used in the OMA database ( http://omabrowser.org ) from the March 2017 release onwards, and can be run on custom genomes using OMA standalone version 2.0 and above ( http://omabrowser.org/standalone ).<p>UNASSIGNED</p> christophe.dessimoz@unil.ch or adrian.altenhoff@inf.ethz.ch.	33	14	i75	28881964		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx229	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881964	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i75/3953943	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx229.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcMwggG_BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGwMIIBrAIBADCCAaUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMpXzweR-QZXzzAWyPAgEQgIIBdto0VcbldTChctLopEdhIsGOU5eTP0Z1VghM1yLe16UoRpkCepAWi5z037B79trWQ8EDH0kIdJGoyZKmz4t8Az9DonvRZLTwOIq4h0W05KQjtFSzj2CebuF70IBW1k9PebAjVgOE-bYemDtOuYgPd_dhmF5bAL1nma4_fujrSSUzLe3knMHYQSaPD_Z8vDVt-LpOM-i2qLGNCqrDvya7sNeaLJDeLNu-9qCRuX6Fupui9N3IMth0vqBdJhQv-POFQ35uJFXYMemWsqPWMJXx1mPkH7sVrpWOQL7yR0_9ZeZD1rCe_lzQDwmwZwTKJAPhRW7PczzLfuSvFAIwDASPHPInnf6v2saHfh_Kr33DnDJCOSVFmBjXrtm5Sr1cyaeRYAYoa3jBBSiK2A1sVhokctrV-fVGtKhEfwfqgiQlPRmdx021TFRhruziV2WlOUPYUHkNyBrU_QFGrWfZl-NQN3T2Lw7W3vcody0VEBXXvDO9tdPW-yvt		28881964.main.html	28881964.main.pdf

The most fundamental text-mining task is the recognition of biomedical named entities (NER), such as genes, chemicals and diseases. Current NER methods rely on pre-defined features which try to capture the specific surface properties of entity types, properties of the typical local context, background knowledge, and linguistic information. State-of-the-art tools are entity-specific, as dictionaries and empirically optimal feature sets differ between entity types, which makes their development costly. Furthermore, features are often optimized for a specific gold standard corpus, which makes extrapolation of quality measures difficult.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> We show that a completely generic method based on deep learning and statistical word embeddings [called long short-term memory network-conditional random field (LSTM-CRF)] outperforms state-of-the-art entity-specific NER tools, and often by a large margin. To this end, we compared the performance of LSTM-CRF on 33 data sets covering five different entity classes with that of best-of-class NER tools and an entity-agnostic CRF implementation. On average, F1-score of LSTM-CRF is 5% above that of the baselines, mostly due to a sharp increase in recall.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> The source code for LSTM-CRF is available at https://github.com/glample/tagger and the links to the corpora are available at https://corposaurus.github.io/corpora/ .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> habibima@informatik.hu-berlin.de.	33	14	i37	28881963		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx228	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881963	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i37/3953940	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx228.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcMwggG_BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGwMIIBrAIBADCCAaUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMJdgh8OuHfzDOCY52AgEQgIIBdsc5mnFovZheu-aa5V8dLPH987WJ5bc4-_GPLSdoO80izLD7mhJSoEnO3MNQJbxKv_2rjKNJjgtnztbStsvFU9qKnxYIoAb3PrW6tF7n1aHQcY3jEbG1cRm4pD2OZWqHdJou8PGCmNND_PPyBZIyqzzjX-F0G39I4KakwN_nS6wr4BaKZheU6iYCV6UOufsyVMnGOznulufRchjXmg87Pu7iUpN6GHzfPO6yH-qOfZZOm9PLYiexN16ToOcp1WDCuQI-_TzQxrIh8Ayk9x0N6zjgmhvF3M3nhFzOmabQqI5Qs9dK4J5r8HTAqUC_OLcygQt37KFeFZOCQqXxF7Tl_kNcHVHXCF3jd6Z8d-1XCNkJBFiWRA3PRz6YiK_lR16mRfgVX72ePNLaDoz3Z38etxq0OuQ_xuT1YeyDuqqZSNBv3ZdY8-RNx4gUa-OULU4UCQkEdOu5-CPrid8O9CkWA62XaTqbRXsEFFHC1k0QD-X0clEPcAqc		28881963.main.html	28881963.main.pdf

Conditioned on a tissue, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are genetic variants associated with gene expression, and eGenes are genes whose expression levels are associated with genetic variants. eQTLs and eGenes provide great supporting evidence for GWAS hits and important insights into the regulatory pathways involved in many diseases. When a significant variant or a candidate gene identified by GWAS is also an eQTL or eGene, there is strong evidence to further study this variant or gene. Multi-tissue gene expression datasets like the Gene Tissue Expression (GTEx) data are used to find eQTLs and eGenes. Unfortunately, these datasets often have small sample sizes in some tissues. For this reason, there have been many meta-analysis methods designed to combine gene expression data across many tissues to increase power for finding eQTLs and eGenes. However, these existing techniques are not scalable to datasets containing many tissues, like the GTEx data.

However, FABIA is restricted to about 20 code units because of the high computational complexity of computing the posterior. Furthermore, code units are sometimes insufficiently decorrelated and sample membership is difficult to determine. We propose to use the recently introduced unsupervised Deep Learning approach Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) to overcome the drawbacks of existing biclustering methods. RFNs efficiently construct very sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input via their posterior means. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm based on the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. Each code unit represents a bicluster, where samples for which the code unit is active belong to the bicluster and features that have activating weights to the code unit belong to the bicluster.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> On 400 benchmark datasets and on three gene expression datasets with known clusters, RFN outperformed 13 other biclustering methods including FABIA. On data of the 1000 Genomes Project, RFN could identify DNA segments which indicate, that interbreeding with other hominins starting already before ancestors of modern humans left Africa.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> https://github.com/bioinf-jku/librfn.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> djork-arne.clevert@bayer.com or hochreit@bioinf.jku.at.	33	14	i59	28881961		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx226	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881961	Wed Nov 29 04:51:19 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i59/3953934	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx226.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcIwggG-BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGvMIIBqwIBADCCAaQGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMs1gXdbeL3s5SAMuPAgEQgIIBddf11EHFkRaM7k6lK2q-OafjWgKfZ_15eFj0curY3Suj-Bt-DY-6GD-vyG6Q7HEGqM3ckAVV3OlVoOd2mZWNspuB7kZ_hsjcO9j3cd9QL4tstlMEJfkoZck-lHrNaIwaVO_Kl5obOUHiJpXZiPdh9iUZcfawcU1KLvHv1v_K3JfbFOCxniGpqdQlPMb09q0dVv8WHF842tROu-nTcoH_8PYz83h9uZ0b3GCUxqFbX7H0HRnFJ55EB19756nDMqAyvzHORg_XM9HGMvWiFY_8QyjbF2mOxHrtMeedwPehQD3guQE80EkfxfjIfkgdD-vwY3rlJxFlN3lyoxq_jGNGBiw2kYlUrXU4ZUcpG5zHZe6ZwO7KjWb1onw5vz6OW3hTzaN2naTqqzkQfw-I5I5p7Pu-WONCIfHTTikGUbgUjIT4sarPaApyJzOLDxSFppbbcw-eAofaySxDZB7PqocfiVXWSQXLxxKHERNSDClTpM-KJqq04KM		28881961.main.html	28881961.main.pdf

In so doing, they present data structures that are different from conventional 1D signal tracks. To exploit the 2D nature of Hi-C contact maps, matrix techniques like spectral analysis are particularly useful. Here, we present HiC-spector, a collection of matrix-related functions for analyzing Hi-C contact maps. In particular, we introduce a novel reproducibility metric for quantifying the similarity between contact maps based on spectral decomposition.

An open platform that is capable of storing a multitude of data types such as clinical, pre-clinical or OMICS data combined with strong visual analytical capabilities will significantly accelerate the scientific progress by making data more accessible and hypothesis generation easier. The open data warehouse tranSMART is capable of storing a variety of data types and has a growing user community including both academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies. tranSMART, however, currently lacks interactive and dynamic visual analytics and does not permit any post-processing interaction or exploration. For this reason, we developed SmartR , a plugin for tranSMART, that equips the platform not only with several dynamic visual analytical workflows, but also provides its own framework for the addition of new custom workflows. Modern web technologies such as D3.js or AngularJS were used to build a set of standard visualizations that were heavily improved with dynamic elements.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> The source code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License and is freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/transmart/SmartR .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> reinhard.schneider@uni.lu.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	2229	28334291		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx137	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334291	Wed Nov 29 08:32:24 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/2229/3064509	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx137.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMHXKhB6e_bZTYq5RFAgEQgIIBdxGcro7LUD_MeioNVVJP4fj-4dZeifMmPt_BOGFOzcna_qRnMN_-mINlCVUqMqUqozpml7aDclsJ0Tmi0dVGj4WbscB001ZY81bXiAOizRfnsBStBehaKezyG7XyTfq8xQBjWgkCyFalamXjePCIRWol2IYpW0rr_Er2jPgtPNiJJ_duS4JNecn3t3SubLutKVfR7_8J6c-nVsc4rbm5rA-ssgmylvH-5-P7oXfsnnD0PhQw61k0obkwPYvXBELO264B9Nn2_nwx9y8a3PT1pGS4WaOwLkk4oyh92m8RfrETx6izlLb0WDy7WKoTu8_VClHpFSGtx-ToJN34X301qr6TKqaHmBKV7v9m1gx1qMrybHv1Y8WxDrScCsOiOhG-9fVYx7T9bJBJccoEJo3lCBx3hCqj205IphcTaE6TdoJC6Sia9NQanMIBGK88KNXv_80XkRXpJVxTPuE1mqme6WX3ARtf9h3neBklO3n0uhAQb9KlvejbKg		28334291.main.html	28334291.main.pdf

Selective whole-genome amplification (SWGA) provides an efficient approach to amplify microbial genomes from complex backgrounds for sequence acquisition. However, the process of designing sets of primers for this method has many degrees of freedom and would benefit from an automated process to evaluate the vast number of potential primer sets.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Here, we present swga , a program that identifies primer sets for SWGA and evaluates them for efficiency and selectivity. We used swga to design and test primer sets for the selective amplification of Wolbachia pipientis genomic DNA from infected Drosophila melanogaster and Mycobacterium tuberculosis from human blood. We identify primer sets that successfully amplify each against their backgrounds and describe a general method for using swga for arbitrary targets. In addition, we describe characteristics of primer sets that correlate with successful amplification, and present guidelines for implementation of SWGA to detect new targets.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Source code and documentation are freely available on https://www.github.com/eclarke/swga .

Whereas structural RNA alignment strategies typically identify common structure for orthologous structured RNAs, clustering seeks to group paralogous RNAs based on structural similarities. However, existing approaches for clustering paralogous RNAs, do not take the compensatory base pair changes obtained from structure conservation in orthologous sequences into account.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Here, we present RNAscClust , the implementation of a new algorithm to cluster a set of structured RNAs taking their respective structural conservation into account. For a set of multiple structural alignments of RNA sequences, each containing a paralog sequence included in a structural alignment of its orthologs, RNAscClust computes minimum free-energy structures for each sequence using conserved base pairs as prior information for the folding. The paralogs are then clustered using a graph kernel-based strategy, which identifies common structural features. We show that the clustering accuracy clearly benefits from an increasing degree of compensatory base pair changes in the alignments.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> RNAscClust is available at http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/RNAscClust .<p>UNASSIGNED</p> gorodkin@rth.dk or backofen@informatik.uni-freiburg.de.<p>UNASSIGNED</p> Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	33	14	2089	28334186		10.1093/bioinformatics/btx114	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334186	Wed Nov 29 08:32:24 2017	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/2089/3056002	https://watermark.silverchair.com/btx114.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcQwggHABgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGxMIIBrQIBADCCAaYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM5L162KVa4yzwUIq_AgEQgIIBd5KzLgXg8Kv8nNITyEVBsKJl0D-QytSW2q0CV_62aZ6kzPSDedDpMM_YV3m0o578kenGMCKW62wYP7Jj0Dbf2tzPWNVtG62vSxIlnFAsxH7ON4ATn4gMOIo5l6-6lIbVoWey7bCb8BCebquaAYNMrSYZQlqjpGhi1AsAIFCEfKe_mGf_wcDS7DLWaUPKO2y6rzrdV3w0C5tFsEsTpN_2xprd58M-pRGncu1GmrDaWkxk_ViAZELbHMh3THqljhUqvyhc7c6ppAlYrtJ5lnM7uyjVlRBIbhfrQSzK8FwZp0RCEV79SagLqYZ_yf9p0iqaBw0FC-shnGgNS88DvCOBOHfq-PAwO2b-4S4Wnu82caSbgxUFKAsn0z7TulqTCz5dCIymzoNOT7m08HuviJhKqPZeAnpE0tzge5U6ddcl4TRPvl0H7tBfCH-IKX0bvwI4o2UDB8y0zPrjfS6fh_fmXGVC_MavYmKD3lOxbbEESHEkb_2ge2KqJQ		28334186.main.html	28334186.main.pdf
